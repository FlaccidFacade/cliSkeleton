# cliSkeleton
a base hello world outline for a cli tool

this repository uses python3.9 and click module to create 
the cli tool

the testing framework is pytest

# First time use
0) Clone/fork the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/FlaccidFacade/cliSkeleton.git
```


1) Python

 Make sure python 3.9 is installed

```
python3 --version
```

 This project is created with 3.9.9

2) Virtual environment

 either use the specific version of python itself
 or use virtualenv and specify

 both create a venv folder in the root dir
 virtualenv is an extra dependency that can be used if
 you choose to use lower version of python like python2

 python:

```
python3.9 -m venv venv
```

 virtualenv:

```
virtualenv --python=python3.9 venv
``` 

3) Activate Virtual Env

 in the same volder the virtual environment was created run:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

 To stop the running invironment run:

```
deactivate
```

4) Dependencies/Requirements

 The requirements.txt file holds all the needed 
 packages for this project. 
 
 This is really the development requirements as it includes 
 the testing framework

  **Note: be sure to adjust this as your project grows 
  and that your virtual environment is activated

```
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

5) Using Cli

 This allows for modules and commands to be simultaneously
 updated and usable

```
pip install -e .
```

 
6) Testing


 To run all tests use python3 and root test directory

 without coverage:

```
python3 -m pytest test/
```

 with coverage:

```
python3 -m pytest --cov=src test/
```

 with coverage report:

```
python3 -m pytest --cov-report xml:cov.xml --cov=src test/
```


## Coverage and Test Setup 

One of the keys to faster and more effective testing is
analyzing test cases with coverage reports

This project uses pytest-cov (and therefore also coverage.py)
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov

pytest docs for ref:
https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/

I like to use a visual representation for coverage report that
maps what lines of code are covered or not with color.

"coverage gutters" vscode extenstion creates an easy to view coverage report

Name: Coverage Gutters
Id: ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters
Description: Display test coverage generated by lcov or xml - works with many languages
Version: 2.8.2
Publisher: ryanluker

1) Setup

  We must have the python path set correctly so that tests will update without having to run pip install . everytime we make a change to the modules.
  make sure to run with your virtual env activated:
